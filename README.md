# Badge-Sytem 🚀
CRUD of 'badges' with a local-hosted API, which acts as a DB.

Actually it's a pretty simple App created for the mere purpouse of practicing. 

You can view, create update and delete badges at your *piacere*.

Also uses Gravatar for the badge's avatars, so if you have an account just put your mail on a new badge and your personal Gravatar Avatar will appear.

Nothing too fancy. 🔧

**To run it on your machine:**

Open your console and throw:

```
git clone https://github.com/Irungaray/Badge-Sytem.git
```

Then:

```
cd badge-system
```

And finally:

```
npm start

// or

yarn start
```

It will host the API and the Client simultaneously with the npm-run-all library, and when it's ready you will be prompted to a new tab in your favorite browser to check this App out.

**Hope you enjoy!** 🍺
